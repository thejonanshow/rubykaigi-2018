# Looking for the code from RubyKaigi?

I used this repo name on the video overlay and then promptly forgot and chose a different name. Sorry about that!

The actual GitHub repository for the exercises filmed at RubyKaigi is [Konuezu](https://github.com/thejonanshow/konuezu).

For more pairing check out my [Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/thejonanshow), or follow me on Twitter if you want to know when and where I'm streaming.

Thanks for watching!
